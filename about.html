            Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as "artists who
            broke through
            the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original ... [I]n the
            form of popular
            music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...", The British poet
            Philip
            Larkin described their work as "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own
            adolescent
            romanticism", and "the first advance in popular music since the War".
        </p>
        <p>The Beatles' 1964 arrival in the US is credited with initiating the album era; the music
            historian Joel Whitburn
            says that LP sales soon "exploded and eventually outpaced the sales and releases of singles" in the music
            industry.
            They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well.
            From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via
            Hollywood films,
            jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis,
            Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band
            among
            a group of people whom they most associated with UK culture.

        <p class="visibility">Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many
            artists have acknowledged the
            Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the
            beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from
            playing any
            "pre-Beatles" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. </p>
